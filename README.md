### Nextjs toast problem app

Hi I want to show a toast when MyComponent mounted .
This is an example of this problem, My real project is different.

I tried sonner in react it's working fine, but in next js it's not working.

I'm using sonner to show toast,


it's working fine when we use button to show toast but it's not working when I want directly render it. using useEffect hook.


Here is the link of documentation for react https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/

If you reading this please help me.
